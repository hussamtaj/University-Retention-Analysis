# University-Retention-Analysis

## Abstract

In this project, my team and I cleaned and analyzed 2017-2019 University of Evansville and aggregated retention data gathered from an early-alert and intervention system for the data consultancy firm EdjAnalytics. We performed descriptive analysis and built two predictive models to improve the Purple Post Retention System to flag at-risk students. This helped the university in making strategic decisions on future policy and prospective students. I also built a shiny app that allows the users to interact with our data and analysis.
